    <p>The really first exercise was made with Chris step by step so it's not very difficult. This version I remade as a practice. For me, the most challenging part is the typesetting with CSS. In the “p” part, I only use “text -align: center” and “text-align: justify”. The result is “p” element aligned to the left edge. I've tried several times and referred to the example document eventually. Now I know have to use “margin- left: auto” and “margin-right: auto” to center the block element with a specific width within its parent container. After spending some time dealing with my mistake, however, I still think the most fascinating part is CSS setting. It makes The interface is neat and easy to read. I believe that it will be very useful for developing a well-organized and visually appealing website if I use it professionally.</p>
