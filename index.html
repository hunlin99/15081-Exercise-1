    <p>The really first exercise was made with Chris step by step so it’s not very difficult. This version I remade as a practice. For me, the most challenging part is the typesetting with CSS. In the “p” part, I only use “text-align: center” and “text-align: justify”. The result is “p” element aligned to the left edge. I’ve tried several times and referred to the example document eventually. Now I know have to use “margin-left: auto” and “margin-right: auto” to center the block element with a specific width within its parent container.</p>
